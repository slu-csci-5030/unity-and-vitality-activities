# Activity: "Mirroring Circle"

**Objective:** Building Unity and Vitality by developing trust, awareness, and connection through this mirror activity.

## Description

Team members form a circle and then pair up with the person next to them. In each pair, one person becomes the “Leader” and the other the “Mirror.” The Leader starts making simple actions, movements, or sounds and the another person tries to do the same as the lead. After 30 seconds to 1 minute, roles switch.

After everyone in the circle has completed a turn in each role, participants regroup to reflect.

## Why This Works

- **Unity:** Encourages alignment and attentiveness through coordinated action.
- **Vitality:** Sparks laughter, energy, and mutual awareness.
- **Psychological Safety:** Builds comfort and trust in being seen and mimicked without judgment.
- **Connection:** Helps people tune into each other physically and emotionally.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. Have the team form a large circle.
2. Asking each person to pair with someone standing next to them.
3. Explaining the two roles: one is the **Leader**, the other the **Mirror**.
4. Round 1: The Leader performs slow, clear movements or sounds for ~30–60 seconds while the Mirror copies.
5. Switch roles after time is up.
6. Optionally, rotate pairs and repeat the activity with new partners.
7. Regroup and reflect: Asking how it felt to lead vs mirror, and what they learned in this activity.
