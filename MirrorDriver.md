# Mirror Driver

**Given** a new software development team  
**When** they engage in the Mirror Driver activity  
**Then** the team builds a unified and vital team culture, with increased psychological safety, trust, and a sense of community

## Overview
The **Mirror Driver** is a dynamic team-building activity designed to foster unity and vitality in a new software development team. Team members pair up, with one acting as the "Driver" who performs simple actions (e.g., lifting a hand, waving, or dancing), and the other as the "Follower" who mirrors those actions exactly. Partners switch roles and pair with new teammates multiple times to build connections. The activity is quick, inclusive, and requires no materials, making it ideal for a company meeting room.

## Objectives
- **Unity**: Promotes alignment through synchronized actions and shared goals.
- **Vitality**: Builds trust and community through playful, collaborative interaction.
- **Psychological Safety**: Creates a safe, non-judgmental environment for self-expression and risk-taking.

## Materials
- No materials required.
- Optional: A timer to switch roles.

## Setup
- **Location**: A company meeting room with enough space for pairs to move safely.
- **Participants**: Suitable for 4–20 participants (scalable; for 8 people, as in the class example, it works perfectly).
- **Duration**: 15 minutes.
- **Safety**: Ensure the room is free of obstacles. All movements should be slow and controlled to accommodate all abilities.
