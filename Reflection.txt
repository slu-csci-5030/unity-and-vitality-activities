## Instructions

**Given** a new software development team in a company meeting room
**When** the facilitator explains the purpose of creating a shared visual representation of team values
**Then** team members understand the goal of fostering trust and connection
And the team is prepared to engage in a unified activity

## Scenario: Individual contributions to shared values

**Given** team members in a meeting room with materials
**When** each participant writes or draws one word, phrase, or symbol representing a team value (e.g., “trust,” “collaboration,” or a simple icon) on a sticky note (3 minutes)
**Then** team members begin aligning on shared values
And trust develops through personal contributions

**Scenario:** Collaborating to build the collage

**Given** team members with individual sticky note contributions
**When** participants take turns placing their sticky notes on a poster board, briefly explaining their choice (5 minutes)
**Then** team members build agreement through shared value discussions
And a sense of community is strengthened

## Scenario: Unifying through group enhancement

**Given** a team that has created an initial collage
**When** the team collectively adds decorative elements (e.g., connecting lines, additional drawings) to unify the collage (3 minutes)
**Then** the team achieves greater unity through shared ownership of the visual
And team members feel a stronger collective purpose

## Scenario: Reflecting to enhance psychological safety

**Given** a team that has completed the collage activity
**When** the facilitator leads a 4-minute discussion, asking questions like “What value resonated most with you?” or “How does this collage reflect our team?”
**Then** team members express feelings of increased psychological safety
And trust and community are reinforced through shared reflections

## Scenario: Ensuring accessibility for all participants

**Given** a team with diverse abilities in a company meeting room
**When** the activity involves simple writing or drawing tasks that can be adapted (e.g., verbal contributions for those with motor or visual impairments)
**Then** all team members, including those with diverse abilities, can participate fully

## Scenario: Adhering to time and cost constraints

**Given** a team-building activity in a company meeting room
**When** the activity is completed in 18 minutes with materials costing under $12
